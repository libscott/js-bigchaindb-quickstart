# JavaScript quickstart for BigchainDB

> :bangbang: High chance of :fire: and :rage: ahead if you expect this to be production-ready

Some naive helpers to get you on your way to making some transactions :boom:, if you'd like to use
JS with [BDB](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb).

Aimed to support usage in browsers or node, but like every piece of :poop:, it might not. Use at
your own risk :rocket:. At least I can tell you it's ES6, so you'll probably need a babel here and a
bundler there, of which I expect you'll know quite well ([otherwise, go check out js-reactor :wink:](https://github.com/bigchaindb/js-reactor)).

## Getting started

Srs, just read through [index.js](./index.js) and see if you can make any sense of it.

> :warning: You might want to check out the [current problems](#current-problems-that-block-usage)
  before commiting too far.

The expected flow for making transactions:

1. Go get yourself some keypairs! Just make a `new Keypair()` (or a whole bunch of them, nobody's
   counting :sunglasses:).
1. Go get yourself a condition! `makeEd25519Condition()` should do the trick :sparkles:.
1. Go get a fulfillment (don't worry about the *why*)! `makeEd25519Fulfillment()` no sweat :muscle:.
1. (**Optional**) You've got everyting you need, except for an asset. Maybe define one (any
   JSON-serializable object will do).
1. Time to get on the rocket ship, baby. `makeCreateTransaction()` your way to lifelong glory and
   fame :clap:!
1. Ok, now you've got a transaction, but we need you to *sign* (`signTransaction()`) it cause, you
   know... cryptography and `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`.
1. Alright, sick dude, you've *finally* got everything you need to `POST` to a server. Phew
   :sweat_drops:. Go `fetch()` your way to business, start:point_up:life4evar!

...

Alright, alright, so you've made a couple transactions. Now what? Do I hear you saying
"<sub>Transfer them??</sub>" No problem, brotha, I gotcha covered :neckbeard:.

1. Go get some more conditions and fulfillments, making sure you create fulfillments to *fulfill* a
   previous transaction's condition (maybe you wanna go check out [this](https://docs.bigchaindb.com/projects/server/en/latest/data-models/crypto-conditions.html)
   and [this](https://docs.bigchaindb.com/projects/py-driver/en/latest/usage.html#asset-transfer)
   and [this](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-thomas-crypto-conditions-01) if you're as confused
   as I think you are).
1. Go make a transfer transaction, using the transaction you want to *spend* in
   `makeTransferTransaction()` :v:.
1. Sign that transaction with `signTransaction()`!
1. `POST` to the server, and watch the :dollar:s drop, man.

## Current Problems That Block Usage

A number of things I have no idea how to solve :fearful::

### SHA256 in JS doesn't match up with Python's

JavaScript:

```js
tx = '{"operation":"CREATE","transaction":{"asset":{"data":{},"divisible":false,"id":"abe4cedb-bc8f-4115-a5e8-e3d225115770","refillable":false,"updatable":false},"conditions":[{"amount":1,"cid":0,"condition":{"cid":0,"details":{"bitmask":32,"public_key":"CGofQAC6xdhATnwbQU1Nj3QALTve2nErHT2RCxjqa6Yk","signature":null,"type":"fulfillment","type_id":4},"owners_after":["CGofQAC6xdhATnwbQU1Nj3QALTve2nErHT2RCxjqa6Yk"],"uri":"cc:4:20:p30HfwAxgDwv2iIGrQWU7y48OqxZgzq8dHH0kru9_I0:96"}}],"fulfillments":[{"fid":0,"fulfillment":null,"input":null,"owners_before":["CGofQAC6xdhATnwbQU1Nj3QALTve2nErHT2RCxjqa6Yk"]}],"metadata":null,"operation":null},"version":1}', 'utf8';

sha256 = crypto.createHash('sha256').update(tx).digest('hex');

// 6d7315a5185bd5a5e1ce027132ea0eb597fe2da61bff091cb94902bc8e997d03
```

Python:

```py
tx = '{"operation":"CREATE","transaction":{"asset":{"data":{},"divisible":false,"id":"abe4cedb-bc8f-4115-a5e8-e3d225115770","refillable":false,"updatable":false},"conditions":[{"amount":1,"cid":0,"condition":{"cid":0,"details":{"bitmask":32,"public_key":"CGofQAC6xdhATnwbQU1Nj3QALTve2nErHT2RCxjqa6Yk","signature":null,"type":"fulfillment","type_id":4},"owners_after":["CGofQAC6xdhATnwbQU1Nj3QALTve2nErHT2RCxjqa6Yk"],"uri":"cc:4:20:p30HfwAxgDwv2iIGrQWU7y48OqxZgzq8dHH0kru9_I0:96"}}],"fulfillments":[{"fid":0,"fulfillment":null,"input":null,"owners_before":["CGofQAC6xdhATnwbQU1Nj3QALTve2nErHT2RCxjqa6Yk"]}],"metadata":null,"operation":null},"version":1}', 'utf8';

sha256 = sha3.sha3_256(tx.encode()).hexdigest()

### tweetnacl-js doesn't provide 32-bit Ed25519 private keys

For some reason, tweetnacl-js only generates [64-byte private keys](https://github.com/dchest/tweetnacl-js/blob/master/nacl.js#L876)
for Ed25519 signature schemes while [five-bells-ledger only accepts 32-byte private keys](https://github.com/interledgerjs/five-bells-condition/blob/master/src/types/ed25519.js#L89).
I guess you'll have to use another Ed25519 package?????
